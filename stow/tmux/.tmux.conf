# ~/.tmux.conf - Managed via stow (package: tmux)

# This sources gpakosz/.tmux from the dotfiles submodule.
# Customizations go in ~/.tmux.conf.local
#
# The DOTFILES env var is set by .zshrc, but tmux may not have it.
# We derive it from where this config file lives (symlinked by stow).

# Get DOTFILES path from the symlink location
